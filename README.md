Simple MEAN Stack application:

It is a very basic application I have developed using MEAN. Followings are covered:

  a. RESTful API implementaion.
  b. CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  
  How to run the application:
  
  1. install Git, node.js, MongoDB.
  2.Clone or download the project.
  3. Delete the node modules folder (you dont need it).
  4. git bash the project folder.
  5. install the server dependencies from package.json (command: npm install).
  6.Run mongoDB demon in another command prompt (command: mongod).
  7. Run the node server in another command prompt (command: node server).
  8. Go to your browser and write the url: http://localhost:3000
